# app-todo

If you can see this message then it means that @Castlecelts forgot to update the readme.

Please slack them or raise an issue assigned to them to have them create a meaningful `README.md` that explains what this service/app does, how it does it, and why it does it WITHOUT a README.

We all know that a service/app without a `README.md` can't work properly.
